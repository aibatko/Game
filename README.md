# Simple Platformer Game

This repository contains a small platformer game built with Python and Pygame. The game currently supports:

- Basic player movement (left, right, and jumping)
- Simple gravity and collision with platforms
- Firing arrows from a bow using the `F` key
- A few example platforms for parkour

## Running the game

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Use the arrow keys to move, `SPACE` to jump, and `F` to shoot arrows.

Further improvements, including multiplayer features, may be added later.
